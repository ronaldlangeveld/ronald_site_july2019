**Telegram is more than just an Instant Messaging App. It's like the Swiss Army Knife of Instant Messaging apps.**

Over the last few months I've become a huge fan of [Telegram](https://telegram.org), thanks to the group [Work in Progress (WIP)](https://wip.chat/) that I'm part of. After joining WIP I soon found my way into many other groups and also started my own few groups on Telegram, many of which have become like family to me. I admit, I'm not the most active person in groups, but I do read most of the messages and enjoy sharing ideas, helping (and asking) in these groups filled with lovely people with similar interests.

BOTS - Now this is where my Swiss Army Knife theory comes in. Telegram have countless bots that does things that traditionally only spacious apps used to do. My favourite being Weather, Music Recognition (bye bye Shazam), Saved Messages (like Notes), Currency Converters, and the Github / GitLab webhooks that notifies me when certain repositories I'm on gets updated.
