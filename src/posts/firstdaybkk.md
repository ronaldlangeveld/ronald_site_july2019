On 10 October 2019 I spontaneously booked a 3 month trip to Thailand.

It's been a few months coming. I made myself a promise to spend New Years outside of South Africa. After some friends, mostly remote workers and software developers said they'll be spending time in Thailand, specifically Chiang Mai, I thought it's a great idea to join them there.

A few days prior to leaving for Thailand, I spent the weekend in Johannesburg/Pretoria for my cousin's wedding. It was pretty cool meeting up with the whole family together, considering I won't be at home for Christmas.

I did however suffer the worst hangover of my life the next morning, so I wasn't quite present during our last breakfast. But I guess it happens.

Fast forward, 4 days later I was on my way to Thailand. Haven't been more excited for a trip, yet it was scary as there's a lot of things unplanned, but according to my friends this is how to do it. 3 Nights in an Airbnb in Bangkok is all I booked in advance. Nice.

During my layover in Dubai my Dad let me know that I've got a second cousin who I never met before living in Bangkok and I should try to meet up with him while I'm there and that he will get in touch with him to contact me.

After another 6 hour flight I finally touched down in Bangkok, got a sim card from AIS and I jumped on a train to my Airbnb.
Upon inserting my sim card I received a whatsapp from my second cousin Lourens, inviting me for dinner the following night and welcoming me to Bangkok. Super awesome!

This was my first time on a train since I left, Seoul 2 years ago. It felt good to be in a place with public transport again.

I arrived at my Airbnb and pretty much went directly to bed.

The next day I explored some surrounding areas to get a taste of Bangkok. I then took a dive into the pool at my Airbnb to kill some of the heat.
Despite being ridiculously hot, I love this and would choose the tropical climate over a cold climate any day.

I did however feel that the swimming pool water is so warm it didn't quite cool me off like it does at home. But it was lovely regardless.

I then took up my second cousin's invite to join them for dinner at their lovely colourful home in Bangkok. ![enter image description here](https://res.cloudinary.com/cinemakers/image/upload/v1548863131/blog/IMG_5691.jpg)

We had amazing spaghetti bolognese for dinner that Lourens' wife Thea made and we were up chatting away and having some beers till 4am when I took a Grab (the south east asian equivalent of Uber) back to my Airbnb.

Considering I only got to bed after 4am, I took it easy this day and just relaxed. I then booked my flight to Chiang Mai for $30 meaning that's my last night in Bangkok. I went to a cafe called Beaston that a friend recommended and did a little bit of work. Later that night I met up with a friend who took me to a market in Bangkok and I had my first taste of Thai market food. I think I had Tom Yum for the first time. Loved the flavour and excited for my time in Thailand.

Tomorrow I'm flying to Chiang Mai. Super excited!
