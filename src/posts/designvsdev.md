## I've come across this quite a few times, where people would confuse the difference between designers and developers.

  
These are the main differences that I simplified. Hopefully everyone can understand this now.

**Designer** = Mockups - using something like Sketch to make it look beautiful. Conceptual. Kinda like a painter or architect.

**Frontend Developer** = Putting the design into code (html, css, javascript, React, Vue, Angular etc) to actually make the thing function like it should from a user point of view.

  

**Backend Developer** = Does all the server side and database stuff (python, php, ruby, NodeJS, MySQL, Mongodb, Postgresql etc).

**Full Stack Developer** = Does both frontend and backend development.

**Unicorn** = Full Stack Developer + Designer. Good luck finding one.
